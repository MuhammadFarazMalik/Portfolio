# FSO Implementation using optisytem

## Overview
A quick summary of the project is provided below. For a complete description of working and functionality, please refer to the attached detailed report.

## Summary
The analysis confirmed the overall resilience of the designed FSO communication system under 
various real-world weather conditions. While attenuation due to environmental factors impacts 
signal quality, particularly at extended distances, the system demonstrates acceptable 
performance metrics across all tested scenarios. These results support the suitability of FSO links 
for practical deployment, especially in urban environments where line-of-sight is available and 
severe weather is intermittent.
