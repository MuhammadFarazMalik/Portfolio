# Audio Denoising using STFT

## Overview
A quick summary of the project is provided below. For a complete description of working and functionality, please refer to the attached detailed report.

## Summary
The project "Audio Denoising Using STFT" aims to improve the clarity of audio 
signals by removing noise. Using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and specific 
filtering techniques, the project tackles audio noise problems, leveraging real-world 
datasets from FSD50K. The implementation includes parameter tuning, spectrogram 
construction, noise spectrum estimation, and the calculation of time-frequency 
attenuation maps. By analyzing input and output signals visually and aurally, the 
project showcases the effectiveness of STFT-based denoising in enhancing audio 
quality
